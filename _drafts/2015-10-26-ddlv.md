## Introduction

When you surf online, you occasionally visit websites that show content like videos or audio files which are dynamically loaded. This is basically done using AJAX calls or sessions where the URLs for these files are generated in some way for which you can not save them by normal means. A scenario would be like, for example, you paid for an online course and you were given an entire set of tutorials that you can watch. At some point of time, you wanted to save all of them for reference or for personal use, but you couldn't do so by normal means or even by using command line tools like [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/) or [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/). Now the question is how would you download such files to your computer?

Well, there are different ways to download them. One way is to use a plugin or extension for the browser like [Grab Any Media](http://grabanymedia.altervista.org/) or [FlashGot](https://flashgot.net/) which can handle such requests and might allow you to download it. Now the thing is, you want to download an entire set of videos that have different URLs. In this case, the plugins or extensions, might work but its takes a long time to manual download each file. A better method would be to create a small script that automates this process. This tutorial aims to teach you guys on how to download the dynamically loaded content in websites in python.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, I would like to give an small introduction to the modules that I am going to use in my python script and the system that I'm using is a Ubuntu Studio 14.04. For the tutorial, you might need to have administrative privileges to install the modules using python-pip.

- [Selenium Web Driver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) : The selenium framework is a suite of tools that can be used to test web applications and also automate the web browser tasks. By using its provided API, you can do simple tasks like automating administration work for a website or some website-related maintenance task by sending commands to the browser. It has support for various programming languages like Python, Java, Javascript, PHP, C#, Perl, Ruby. To install this framework for python, just type the following command in the terminal :

```bash
pip install selenium
```

- [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) : The bs4 a HTML/XML parser that does a great job at screen-scraping elements and getting information like the tag names, attributes and values. It also has set of methods that allow you do tasks like, to match certain instances of a text and retrieve all the elements that contain it. To install this python module, type the following command in the terminal :

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

- [Python-Wget](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wget) : This module is a python port for the wget command-line program. Its easy to setup and you can quickly download videos or files to your system by using it API. You can follow the "tradition" method of downloading files like using the urllib or by doing a subprocess call to the wget command-line program, but for this tutorial, I will be using this module to get the job done. To install it to your system, type the following command in the terminal :

```bash
pip install wget
```

- [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) (Optional) : The PhantomJS is a headless browser( doesn't have a front-end GUI and everything works at the backend) that is used for web page interaction. It is similar to the selenium web driver but the difference is that, it is headless. For this tutorial, I will be using the basic Firefox web driver via selenium, but you can test this out if you do not want a browser to popup every time the script runs. You can download the phantomjs executable from their homepage, but I advice you to use a downgraded version of this as the latest one might not be compatible with selenium module.
