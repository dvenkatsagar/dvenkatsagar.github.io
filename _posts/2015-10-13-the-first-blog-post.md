## Introduction

Hello everyone, I am Sagar D.V, a developer/web designer, currently doing my Masters in Computers and Information Sciences at Florida State University.
I'm a techie who loves to experiment with Virtual Reality gaming and WebGL graphics. I did create some projects like Python-yad, Reveal-charts, Speech-to-program Editor.
Most of the projects that I've done are either plug-ins or interfaces for bigger projects. So if your are interested, you can check out my [portfolio]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/), to find out more. To know more about me, you can check it out [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/).

## Mission

My mission is to share the knowledge that I gained from some interesting technology that I come across and experiment with. So I will be posting on what I learned and some tricks, tips and workarounds that will help developers and users. There will also be tutorials and presentations about the experiments that I've done.

So if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

This is just the first post, and there are more to come.
